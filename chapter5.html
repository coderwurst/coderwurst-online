                                <li>every method MUST declare a return type, or if nothing is to be returned, the void keyword</li>
                                <li>once a method declares a return variable, the method must include a return statement</li>

                                <li>max number of parameters of 255, though good design involves usually only passing a handful of parameters</li>
                                <li>parameters can include objects, enumeration types or primitives, each type is specified before the variable name</li>

                                <li>may only contain one line of code, to 100 lines - again good design will keep method sizes to 7 - 10 lines</li>
                                <li>if the method specifies a return type, the method must include a return statement that returns a matching data type as specified in the header</li>

                                <li>a class comprises of 2 things - variables and methods</li>
                                <li>instance variables make up the state of the object</li>
                                <li>methods are responsible for all actions</li>
                                <li>methods contained in objects, must be called from an instance of the object it is part of</li>
                                <em> Class myClass = new Class ();<br>
                                    myClass.method(params);</em>
                                </ul>

                                <br>
                                <b>Overloading a Method</b> <ul>
                                <li>when more than 1 method shares the same name, but has a different list of parameters</li>
                                <li>the param list may be composed of more or less parameters as the other method</li>
                                <li>useful when 1 operation can be carried out with a varying amount of info</li>
                                <li>when a max of 5 parameters can be entered, the other 4 can be set to defaults which will be used unless the user enters more, how many the user enters determines which overloaded method is used</li>
                                <li>overloaded methods are not required to have the same return types as their predecessors</li>
                                <li>for example, a method to add ints can be overloaded to add doubles</li>
                                <li>the compiler determines which overloaded method to use, depending on the parameters passed in</li>
                                <li>important to design overloaded methods so that they behave in a similar manner - 2 methods with the same name should be seen to be very similar, otherwise perhaps a separate method would be better implemented</li>
                                </ul>

                                <b>Passing Primitives by Value to Methods</b> <ul>
                                <li>when a PRIMITIVE is passed into a method, a copy of the value is made and is passed into the method</li>
                                <li>if a method sets the value of the parameter to a different value, it has no effect on the initial variable</li>
                                <li>therefore the original variable passed in will not have been changed</li>
                                </ul>

                                <br />
                                <b>Passing Objects by Reference to Methods</b> <ul>
                                <li>instead of making of a parameter when it is an object, a reference to the original object is passed</li>
                                <li>a reference is an internal index that represents the object</li>
                                <li>this results in the actual object values also being manipulated by the method</li>
                                </ul>

                                <br />
                                Typical exam Question to show a code example and a number of correct answers depending on if an object or a variable has been used as a parameter - easy to trip up on! <br />


                                <br><b>Understanding Variable Scope</b> <ul>
                                <li>scope is a term used to refer to a section of the code which has access to a declared variable, this can be from a few lines to an entire package</li>
                                <li>this helps in larger programs to prevent unintentional updating of the wrong variable, and allows for variable names to be reused in different sections of the codebase</li>
                                </ul>

                                <br />
                                <b>Local Variables</b> <ul>
                                <li>declared inside of methods</li>
                                <li>commonly declared at the beginning of a method, though can be declared anywhere in code</li>
                                <li>scope extends to ONLY this method</li>
                                <li>typically used only once, or only used in 1 method</li>
                                <li>the borders of the scope are determines by braces { } surrounding the method body</li>
                                <li>a variable declared in a method body, cannot be accessed by anything outside the braces { }</li>
                                <li>a code block can also be created within another code block - e.g.. for loops and if statements, in this case a variable scope includes the block in which it is declared, and any further blocks within this initial block</li>
                                <li>therefore a variable declared in a method with nested ifs, can be used throughout the if statements</li>
                                <li>a variable declared in the innermost if statement, cannot be accessed by any of the surrounding statements</li>
                                <li>variables must only have a unique name if they are included in the same scope</li>
                                <li>common uses for local variables are for count variables and for a variable that the method will eventually return</li>

                                <li>commonly used for object variables, which can be manipulated by more than one method in the class</li>
                                <li>ie. instance variables are commonly used to store information about the state of the object</li>

                                <li>and initialised with the objects constructor, which sets all initial values for the object and prepares the object to be used</li>
                                <li>the next stage of the object lifecycle is the ready state, when it is ready to have its methods used, an object remains in this state as long as there is still a reference to this object in the code - this is where an object will spend most of its time</li>
                                <li>once there are no longer any active references to an object, it is eligible to be removed by the Java garbage collector, only after it has been removed can the memory allocated to an object be reused by another object</li>

                                <li>if a method or local variable has the same name as an instance variable, this can be used to refer explicitly to the instance variable</li>
                                <li>i.e. if a class has an instance variable myVariable, and a method in the class passes a parameter called myVariable, this.myVariable refers to the initial class variable, NOT the myVariable passed in as a parameter</li>
                                <li>if this is not used in the above case, any reference to myVariable would manipulate the parameter</li>
                                <li>can also be used to rewrite the class by calling a constructor from inside of a method</li>

                                <li>a constructor can also use the this keyword, to refer to methods and constructors in the same object</li>
                                <li>the constructor or method which accepts the most parameters will then do the work</li>
