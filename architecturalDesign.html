            <h2 class="h2">Architectural Engineer - Germany</h2>
            <br>
            <p>Employed as an Architectural Technician, the firm specialised in chemical laboratory
            projects and is based right in the centre of the main chemical development region
            in Europe. This challenge provided me with many obstacles to overcome, as well 
            as technical and chemical terms that many of the native population of Germany
            would at least have to think twice about, there was the added complications of
            such an industry with regards to health and safety whilst carrying out investigations 
            with hazardous materials. Projects varied from development institutes, to University
            laboratories. Each project was very different, involving mainly aspects relating to
            Chemistry, Physics and Biology.</p>

            <p>My responsibilities grew within a relatively short time to include liason with 
                suppliers, to overcome space issues whilst maintaining an exceptionally high level 
                of safety for the user. Then, I was able to go back to my desk and design a solution
                to the problem faced, before passing this information on to our representative on 
                site or in some cases I had the opportunity of attending site meetings myself with the other 
                consultants and relay this information myself.<p>
                
            <p>I am grateful for the opportunities that I received here - because of these, 
                I learned the more about how a German office works in this position than any
            other. I have thought about it many times, and people ask me frequently; how do the
            Germans work, what makes them so different from us? Unfortunately there is no simple
            answer. When your there, it seems that there is an unwritten procedure that everyone works to. I simply
            turned up and slotted into this procedure. Maybe it is to do with their society, which 
            is much different than in the UK. They definitely don't have a magic recipe for it, their 
            system simply works and works well.</p>

            <h2 class="h2">Telecommunication Site Planning</h2>
            <br>
            <p>Working as a self-employed contractor I took on a number of projects
            through a friend working with UK mobile providers as they replaced 
            mobile masts and sites with newer technologies. The task was simple; 
            a surveyor would send through photographs, a site survey and technical 
            information on a site, and it was my job to create detailed CAD drawings from this
            information. CAD is one of those things I can start into and not notice as
            the day passes.</p>

            <p>Self-employment takes a lot of self motivation. I had that, working
            sometimes between 8 and 14 hours a day when there was work on the table.
            What drove me to leave the business, is the periods in between when there
            is no work. It wasn't even about the money, it was simply being bored for 
            hours, days and sometimes weeks on end whilst waiting for the next 
            batch of drawings to come through. As a self declared sufferer of a higher
            than average level of OCD - this lack of routine got to me quite quickly.<p>
                
            <p>Having said that I am still open to side projects involving similar work.
            Technical drawing is a skill that I would like to continue to develop. I look for 
            small jobs on volunteering sites, or just odds and ends 
            from contacts still in the industry - just something to get the mind going
            through the gears again.</p>

            <h2 class="h2">Pratikant - Bonn</h2>
            <br>
            <p>A short and sweet working as a placement student at a busy central 
            Architecture office in Bonn, provided me with an insight into how the 
            profession worked in Germany. I found it to be in some ways very similar
            but in others to be very very different.</p>

            <p>I was tasked within this position to help a architect on
            a number of his projects. This involved firstly learning a new tool - 
            Nemetschek Allplan. This is a German made piece of software, I saw it
            in the beginning as a cross between Google Sketchup and Autocad. I picked 
            up the software within a week, and discovered that it is in fact a very
            powerful tool to have. I assume that I hadn't heard of it before as it, at the
            time, was only available in German. Very easy to use as a design tool, on the click
            of a button the user can have access to full 3D and detailed drawings. The software 
            also provides functionality to price the components, and schedule the build, all with
            minimal extra effort.<p>
                
            <p>Having got up to speed with the tools, I was given a number of survey tasks, some of 
            which involving taking measurements for a refurbishment job and others visiting on site 
            projects and documenting progress whilst speaking with the clients and contractors. I was only
            able to get a months experience here, but am pleased to say that my last project before I 
            left was my most rewarding; a 3D model of a roof conversion and house extension that was to 
            be used on presentation boards for the client. One which I delivered on time and to a high standard.</p>
            
            <p>After gaining this experience, it became clear to me that Architecture in Germany
            was a lot different to what I had studied. I spoke with the architects working there, 
            who suggested that if I wanted to continue my career as an architect in Germany, to go back
            to University and learn it the way that had learned. Otherwise they saw my studies as a possible
            hindrance to getting a permanent job. After consideration and as a result of consultation with 2
            of the main Universities in the area, I decided not to go down this route.</p>

            <h2 class="h2">Technical Specialist - Cologne</h2>
            <br>
            <p>My first construction job in Germany - it was sold to me as a position representing
            the company to contractors and architects. The company is involved in private, hydraulic
            powered lifts, designed for home use but in some cases also used for small commercial and 
            public buildings.</p>

            <p>After 4 weeks of intense training, I was happy enough that I had made the right choice. I 
            was competent in the technical aspects of the job, I had worked hard on getting the language
            up to scratch (German office language is somewhat different from day-to-day use), and I felt 
            I was in a good position to get started in the construction industry.<p>
            
            <p>The job however quickly turned out to be not at all what I had expected. More of a paper-pushing
            position, where I found myself more and more involved with the contractual side of projects and the
            management of installation teams and the ordering of custom parts. I quickly became unhappy in the
            position, and decided I had to leave as quickly as possible. I did get the chance to utilize 
            my CAD skills once, and also was commended on my performance from a building contractor regarding my 
            ideas for solving a major problem we had on site. Apart from these 2 instances, I can't really think 
            of any rewarding experiences during my time here.</p>
            
            <p>I think my experience in this job was down to my understanding of the position offered at the 
            interview stage. What I saw and what they offered were apparently 2 separate things. From this point 
            on I went into interviews with a lot more questions prepared regarding what the position actually entailed. At 
            the end of the day I had spent time at a company where I could have perhaps developed more somewhere else. I
            didn't however leave completely empty handed, I got numerous lessons in the German office culture of being held
            accountable for your actions, unfortunately in my experience it was only when something hadn't gone to plan. None
            the less, I took it as a step in the right direction, and sought out my next challenge.</p>

            <h2 class="h2">Kitchen Planner</h2>
            <br>
            <p>Maybe not something everyone with an Architecture degree
            would have thought of, but I really enjoyed my time planning kitchens 
            for one of Europes biggest home furnishing retailers. The idea behind
            kitchen planning is relatively straightforward, but the customers keep 
            things interesting by throwing any number of unique problems to overcome.</p>

            <p>Having worked in Retail since I left school and while I was studying 
            in University, I thrived in a customer facing environment. The customer
            had their own ideas, I knew what could or could not be done, and it was the
            interaction involved in making the 2 match up that made this job so 
            interesting.<p>
                
            <p>Sometimes my architectural background did come in very useful, with 
            the odd customer planning to take down a wall or relocate water services 
            within their kitchen. All of which I could at least give them a bit of
            information about, and a few of my ideas as to what and how it could be
            done. The other benefit of this job was when the proud 
            customers came back into visit and show off their new kitchens after 
            installation. It gave me a lot of satisfaction to know that the job 
            had been done so well, the customer was wanted to brag about it.</p>

            <h2 class="h2">Architectural Assistant</h2>
            <br>
            <p>One year's work placement and another year part time whilst I was finishing my degree
            was my time in the UK Construction industry. In that time I learned a lot form some great
            people. I struggled at the start with the office job, set hours where most people only moved from
            their desk to leave at the end of the day. Office jobs also require a completely different form
            of self motivation, one I still struggle with as I previously thrived a lot off the customer 
            interaction that retail provides (even when dealing with a complaint).</p>
            
            <p>Site surveys, outline design, planning, working and detail drawings as well as 3D 
            modelling and rendering were all tasks I took on working with several others, over a wide
            range of high profile projects in the city. I had a lot of help in learning AutoCad and 3D
            modelling software such as 3DSMax. I also gained experience in different types of projects, 
            including  conservation, regeneration, refurbishment and new build.<p>

            <p>The first project I was involved in was a Pharmaceutical Building. I worked as an assistant to the project architect, producing 3D models and proposed drawings for a new hospital building in one of Belfast's most established hospitals. I enjoyed the modeling work, and talking with the nurses and pharmacists who worked in the existing facility in order to meet their day to day needs with the new building. I carried out surveys and specifications.<p>
 
            <p>I then gained experience on a longer running project, the refurbishment and extension of a listed museum building, which ran over five years. I started at the construction phase and worked with the contractors on site to provide them with any drawings they needed throughout the build. I was also involved in site meetings and surveys, to continually assist in the smooth running of the build. As the building was older than usual and listed there were a lot of challenges to deal with.</p>

            <p>The third major project I was involved in was a cultural centre for arts and music in the heart of Belfast, and was another refurbishment and extension project. Working as an assistant to the project Architects, I was involved with production of presentation boards for client shows and meetings. This involved a lot of photoshop and CAD drawings in order to communicate effectively the ideas from the Architect to the client.</p>
 
            <p>One of the few residential projects I was involved in was a residential houseing project. This was the first project where I was allowed more freedom. I was asked to create an outline proposal for a housing development that involved two new houses, in addition to an extension of the existing property.The plans were put through the local planning authority and accepted after minimal amendments, and the client was satisfied to have the plans ready to go, after they found a suitable developer for the project.</p>
 
            <p>The final major project I was able to work on was a welfare building for minorities. There were a lot of people from different backgrounds that the design team had to work with. I worked with the project architect from initial design to the completion of the build, and was very excited and satisfied to work with a project to completion.  This was another project  I used as part of my university dissertation. It involved consideration of the sustainability issues of a project in a built up urban area  with many environmental concerns.</p>

              <h4><b>about</b></h4>
            <p>Architectural Technology is all about the details... From understanding
                the project requirements, to the behaviours of building materials and the 
                effective use of space,I am still thoroughly interested in good Architecture. 
               During my placement, I had the opportunity to work on a number of highly 
               interesting and unique commercial projects such as a listed museum, a pharmaceutical 
               facility and a large community centre project. I had to leave this job at the
               inset of the recession in Ireland, and moved about (both Geographically
               and in terms of job direction) whilst trying to find a long term career. After a total of 5 years
               in a number of construction industry jobs, I decided I had given it a fair do, and as I had still
               not found something concrete, I took on a new challenge in Software development. I still
               look for small, side projects involving CAD drawing so that I can maintain my
               technical drawing skills and it still brings me satisfaction completing drawing tasks.
