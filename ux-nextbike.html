                            <strong>Does the site or application give the user value?</strong><br>
                            The idea of bike rentals is nothing new to me, having made use of similar services in Belfast and Dublin. However this is the first time such a service 
                            has been provided in my current location, Bonn. The site looks relatively modern, there is however a questionable amount of information on the landing page - 
                            a user can not directly begin his or her search for a nearby bike, but instead is provided with a lot of information regarding registering and about 
                            the service itself. for someone who is already familiar with the practice of renting a bike, this information was unnecessary and held me back from the 
                            task I wished to carry out. However I can imagine for new users it provides a channel of assurance for something new. The site has all the necessary 
                            features required for providing such a service, and has a relatively neat Information Architecture.
                            <br><br>
                            <strong>Does the user find the site or application simple to navigate?</strong><br>
                            The site follows a typical web standard for a top navigation - logo and home button on left hand side of screen, 1st level navigation on the right. Language 
                            options clutter the header a little bit, I would prefer this option to be automatically set from my browser settings with a secondary option in the footer as 
                            back up. Call to Action Button in header is for registration - questionable if this is needed in top navigation as several other buttons available on start page 
                            or other under pages in journey. Footer a little overloaded with logos of partners, but overall a well presented area to finish off the page.
                            <br><br>
                            <strong>Does the user actually enjoy using the site or application?</strong><br>
                            As my attempt to register seemed to have failed, I was relatively disappointed with the site. I also see no option to resend a pin myself, and have to contact
                            support for further help. The ‘How To’ section of the site seems to outline a streamlined process, from registering to downloading the app, to finding and 
                            renting the first bike. Once I hear back from support I will be sure to try the full experience!\<br>
                            I was a little disappointed at the search function - I view this as the main functionality of the service, and its hidden in the menu instead of appearing on 
                            the first page. There is also no way to search with a postcode - the most convenient method of locating an address. Instead, the user has to manually enter 
                            the city, scroll to the location they want to search and then look for bikes.
