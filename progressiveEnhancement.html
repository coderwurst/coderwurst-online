                        <p>

                        <p>The idea behind Progressive Enhancement is nothing new; it has been 
                            around since the mid 00s. Jeremy Keith (co-founder of Clearleft - 
                            <a href="http://clearleft.com" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">http://clearleft.com </a> ) 
                            sums up the theory as not a particular technique or technology, 
                            instead a robust engineering approach that provides: <em> "a way of 
                                looking at things, a way of viewing how you build"</em> (2014).
                        </p>

                        <p>Progressive Enhancement is not only to do with JavaScript – anything 
                            other than HTML can be seen as an enhancement including; an interactive 
                            element that requires a mouse, as not all devices have a mouse attached; 
                            information presented visually on screen, cannot be appreciated by 
                            people with a visual impairment; or video and audio without transcripts 
                            and/ or subtitles are unsuitable for the hearing impaired.
                        </p>
                        
                        
                        <br>
            
            <h2>Graceful Degradation vs. Progressive Enhancement</h2>
            <p>Since the mid 90s the web dev community based their work on the 
                <em>Graceful Degradation </em> concept. Taken from the world of 
                engineering, this approach is about providing users with the 
                latest and greatest browsers the maximum experience (using the 
                most modern tools available), whilst leaving older or otherwise 
                more limited browser versions with the leftovers, with little 
                attention being paid beyond fixing major problems. This is easily 
                noticeable when looking at mobile devices, with functionality 
                dropping from desktop to tablet, and then dropping again from 
                tablet to phone.</p>

            <br>
            <p align="center"> </p> <p> It's worth to note that people running 
                devices without JavaScript may not be responsible – perhaps the 
                device they are using doesn't support JavaScript, or the settings 
                have been disabled and the user has no ability to re-activate it 
                (due to security constraints). It also isn't just to do with 
                JavaScript being deactivated – temporary network errors, DNS l
                ookup failures, antivirus and personal firewall software can all 
                have adverse effects on running JavaScript.
            </p> 
            
            <p>In 2003 at the SXSW conference in Texas, Steve Champeon and Nick 
                Finck presented "Inclusive Web Design for the Future", unveiling 
                a new blueprint for approaching web development – <em>Progressive Enhancement</em> . 
                This approach focuses on the content instead of the browser. 
                Such a website is defined and built from scratch so that it 
                works for everybody, regardless of the technology available. After 
                a baseline website with complete functionality has been achieved; 
                the web experience can be further enhanced (progressively) for 
                users & /or devices that have JavaScript running – this typically 
                involves greater functionality for richer features (the bells 
                and whistles!!).
            </p>

            <p><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper"><img class="confluence-embedded-image confluence-external-resource" src="http://designshack.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/ds-mobilefirst-2.jpg" data-image-src="http://designshack.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/ds-mobilefirst-2.jpg"></span></p>
            <em>image taken from <a href="http://designshack.co.uk/">designschack.com</a></em></p>
            <p>Using the < em>Progressive Enhancement </em> approach when developing 
                a site is not only beneficial to the user experience, but it means 
                that as the website is accessible without JavaScript, the site will 
                continue to work in the event that a bug is introduced into the 
                code… Other advantages include performance enhancements and greater 
                ease with modular web design.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h2>Adopting a Progressive Enhancement Strategy</h2>
            <p>Ascertain the Information Architecture of the site</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Organise available content</li>
                <li>Create wireframes for presentation</li>
                <li>Prioritise elements which you want to display, and from this
                    start the coding with these HTML elements in the correct order</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Cascading Stylesheets (CSS)</p>
            <ul>
                <li> Multiple, external stylesheets to improve workflow and help 
                    gain a greater consistency of presentation across the alternate 
                    media types, such as screen, print or mobile</li>
                <li>The combination of multiple style sheets works well with 
                    making informed decisions about how the stylesheets are 
                    connected, improving scalability and how to hide certain 
                    layouts from problematic browsers</li>
            </ul>
            <p> Unobtrusive JavaScript
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Remove all inline event handlers and move JavaScript to 
                    linked external files, rather than using script tags </li>
                <li>Conditional statements can discern the selectors to be used 
                    and in which situations they are applicable – allowing for 
                    effective management of the inter-relationship of CSS and 
                    JavaScript</li>
                <li>Scripts written to take advantage of browser support, but 
                    not deny access if that support is unavailable</li>
            </ul>
            
            <br>

                <br>
            <p><strong>Step 1 – Make it work (content)</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li> Websites should be built on a <strong> baseline</strong> of usable code</li>
                <li >Users (and search engine spiders) should be able to understand page content without the need of any scripting</li>
                <li>New pages or features should be able to work with HTML alone – no images, no CSS, no JavaScript</li>
                <li>Interactive Elements only implemented with forms and server-side processing</li>
                <li>Use of good semantic markup incorporating HTML5's new elements and attributes</li>
                <li>Website will work in most browsers, for as many people and devices as possible including older legacy browsers and devices</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong> Step 2 – Make it Work Better (presentation)</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li> Extra layers then added to the baseline</li>
                <li>Images, advanced styling, interactions, validation of data, charts and data tables</li>
                <li>Use of CSS3 makes it possible for the design to 'jump off the page'</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong> Step 3 – Add JavaScript or jQuery behaviours</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li> Client side scripts added for greater functionality</li>
                <li>Each progress step is a single addition – something extra 
                    that more modern browsers are capable of doing</li>
                <li>Accessible and Usable experience</li>
                <li>As much Content and Interactivity as possible </li>
            </ul>
            <p>It is important to remember that we want our websites not just 
                to be available for users today, but also for users in the 
                coming days, months and years!
