                        <b>Inheritance</b>
                        <ul>
                        <li>allows dev to create general classes that can be used as a foundation for more specific classes</li>
                        <li>typical animal example - general class Animal.java, specific classes Dog, Cat and Horse.java</li>
                        <li>general class shares common elements - colour, weight, age, etc. and method to do common activities such as eat, move and rest</li>
                        <li>the purpose of this general class is to prevent code repetition in each of the more specific animal type classes</li>
                        <li>benefits of this are greater than less code, also makes bug resolution and code maintenance easier, new code can be added to the general class and be readily accessible to all child classes</li>
                        <li>duplicated code also increases the risk that the same code in different classes performs differently as it goes through the dev process, unless each block of code is updated exactly the same</li>
                        <li>general classes also allow for <b>polymorphism</b> - in the above instance, a Dog object can be referred to and treated as an Animal object</li>
                        <li>the base class is known as the superclass, which is extended by child or sub classes, which in turn inherit all of the nonprivate variables and methods</li>
                        <li>a class can only extend 1 superclass, however, a class can inherit from one class which inherits from another and so on</li>
                        <li>once a class inherits a superclass, it gains non-private methods and variables, and adds to that any specific variables in its own class OR remain simply as it is</li>
                        <li>X extends Y is the same as saying Y inherits from X</li>
                        </ul>
                        <br>
                        <b>Overrriding Methods</b> <ul>
                        <li>used when methods must be slightly tailored for a subclass</li>
                        <li>eg, if a fish object was created, it does not move it swims...</li>
                        <li>the initial method can be overridden by declaring another method in the Fish class with the same name and adding the annotation for @override</li>
                        <li>when the move method is then called for a Fish object, the overridden method in the Fish class is executed</li>
                        <li>note that for an overrride, the method signatures must be identical</li>
                        <li>the use of the keyword <b>super</b> can be used to access an overridden method</li>
                        <li>an example of this would be a horse object, as horses need to stand before resting, a typical rest method would move the horse into a standing position, before callinging the overridden rest.super() method - again parameters must match exactly</li>
                        <li>therefore it is possible to have additional functionality in an overriding method, before the initial overridden class is called</li>
                        </ul>
                        <br>
                        <b>Abstract Classes</b> <ul>
                        <li>concrete classes are regular classes that can be instantiated</li>
                        <li>abstract classes cannot be instantiated, and may contain abstract methods - methods that are not implemented</li>
                        <li>abstract methods must have a valid method signature, and must be overridden and implemented in a concrete class which extends an abstract class</li>
                        <li>an abstract class can extend another abstract class, without implementing its methods</li>
                        <li>it is also possible for an abstract class to have variables inherited by any concrete class which extends the abstract class</li>
                        <li>an example is a program for a music player - which can be used by a mp3 player, a cd player, a computer, a phone, etc etc</li>
                        <li>an abstract class for this program may contain methods such as play, stop and change volume</li>
                        <li>not only is the abstract keyword used in the class name, but in any abstract methods within the class</li>
                        </ul>

                        <pre><code> public abstract class MusicPlayer {
    public abstract void play(){ };
    public abstract void stop() { };
    public void changeColume() {
    // change volume level;
    }
}</code></pre><ul>
                        <li>every abstract method MUST be implemented by the first concrete subclass - these methods cannot be shared between subclasses, as for example, the mp3 player will first need to decode the file and then play, whilst the cd player will need to start reading the disk and then play</li>
                        </ul>
                        <br>
                        <b>Interfaces</b> <ul>
                        <li>used to define a required set of functionalities for the classes that implement the interface</li>
                        <li>different from extending a base class, as a class is free to implement as many interfaces as needed</li>
                        <li>similar to an abstract class with all abstract methods</li>
                        <li>similar to abstract classes, when a concrete class implements an interface class, all the methods contained in the interface must be implemented</li>
                        <li>an abstract class that implements an interface class must not implement all methods contained in the interface, but the first concrete class which extends this abstract class must</li>
                        <li>interfaces are used to create a standard public interface for similar items, which makes thee code more modular</li>
                        <li>when more than one interface is being implemented, they are separated with a comma delimited list</li>
                        <li>the use of an interface ensures that any class implementing it will have the same public methods as other classes - an example is a Phone interface class used with a CellPhone, LandlinePhone and VideoPhone object. The VideoPhone class may also implement an interface for a VideoPlayer</li>
                        </ul>

                        <br>
                        <b>Advanced Concepts of Inheritance</b> <ul>
                        <li>every class inherits from the base class Object.java - this is implied and does not have to be specifically accessed using the extends keyword</li>
                        <li>this means that, to start off with, we have at least 1 inherited class</li>
                        <li>if we extend the animal class in the dog class, we inherit not only the animal class but also the object class</li>
                        <li>if a class overrrides a method in another, the overridden class is passed down</li>
                        <li>an inheritance chain is created between multiple classes, and can be continued as long as it makes computing sense in the application</li>
                        <li>an interface can also extend multiple interface classes using the extends keyword and a comma delimited list for more than one interface</li>
                        </ul>

                        <br>
                        <b>Encapsulation</b> <ul>
                        <li>encapsulation is the concept of storing data together with methods that operate on that data</li>
                        <li>the code is stored in an object</li>
                        <li>encapsulation allows for data and method hiding - a.k.a. information hiding</li>
                        <li>this makes it possible to expose a public interface while hiding the implementation details</li>
                        </ul>

                        <br>
                        <b>Good design with Encapsulation</b> <ul>
                        <li>one of the benefits of O-O programming, is the association between methods and variables in the code, other languages which do not have this relationship make finding the source of bugs a lot harder</li>
                        <li>encapsulation attempts to solve such problems, code is created in an object container (classes), making it modular</li>
                        <li>a well encapsulated class has a single and clear purpose - and contain the methods and variables needed to fufill this purpose</li>
                        <li>the purpose of a well encapsulated class should be clearly defined</li>
                        <li>some say encapsulation is only about the grouping of related methods and variables, for the OCA exam, it also involves the information hiding of the implementation details</li>
                        </ul>

                        <b>Access Modifiers</b> <ul>
                        <li>the keywords that define access</li>
                        <li>allow a dev to determine which parts of a class are viewable and accessible outside of the class</li>
                        <li>3 defined modifiers, as well as a default (blank)</li>
                        <li>can also be used when defining classes, but not in exam</li>
                        </ul>

                        <b>private</b> <ul>
                        <li>most restrictive, and most commonly used</li>
                        <li>any methods or variables declared as private, can only be accessed within that class</li>
                        <li>subclasses CANNOT access private methods in superclasses</li>
                        </ul>

                        <b>default (package-private)</b> <ul>
                        <li>the second most restrictive</li>
                        <li>allows access only within the same package</li>
                        <li>no declaration (left blank)</li>
                        </ul>

                        <b>protected</b> <ul>
                        <li>3rd most restricted</li>
                        <li>same as default but allows subclasses outside of a package access</li>
                        <li>must be in the same package, or be a subclass of a class within the same package</li>
                        </ul>

                        <b>public</b> <ul>
                        <li>least restrictive</li>
                        <li>2nd most common</li>
                        <li>provides no restriction - any method can access a public method or variable</li>
                        <li>a.k.a world access</li>
                        </ul>

                        <b>Information Hiding</b> <ul>
                        <li>hiding the implementation details of a class</li>
                        <li>achieved through access modifiers</li>
                        <li>this provides the dev control as to how data is accessed, and therefore reduces the risk of bugs as outside objects can be controlled</li>
                        <li>often, a class will contain more internal methods to process the data, and a few public getters and setters to allow access from outside to provate variables</li>
                        <li>general design involved assuming private first, which helps reduce bugs, and only change if necessary</li>
                        </ul>

                        <b>Exposing Object functionality</b> <ul>
                        <li>any methods within a well incapsulated class that are used to manipulate the data should be private</li>
                        <li>public methods within a class can also be thought of as interfaces, which allow access to the class functionality</li>
                        <li>external objects have no knowledge of the class implementation, only of the public getters and setters</li>
                        <li>getters provide read access, and setters wrtie access to provate variables</li>
                        <li>getters should start with a lowercase getSomethingSomething, as setters start with setSomethingSomething</li>
                        <li>the one exception to the above convention is when dealing with boolean values - isSomething would be used</li>
                        </ul>
