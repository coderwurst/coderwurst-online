                        <h2>app apk</h2>
                        <p>The first task is to download the app apk from 
                            <a href="http://www.coderwurst.com/samsAppResources/student_attendance.apk">this link</a>. 
                            Once 
                        downloaded onto your device, follow the following steps to install the APK 
                        on your Android Device (min v11.0): </p>
                        
                        <ol>
                            <li>Go to Settings -> Security and check the box to 
                            enable unknown sources. A pop up box may appear, click 
                            ok. This is necessary to install any APK file directly 
                            on an Android device</li>
                            <li>Navigate to the directory on your device where you 
                            have downloaded the apk. I usually download APKs to 
                            my dropbox, as it is very easy to navigate to on my 
                            tablet. Once you have located the apk file, click on 
                            it. A pop up will appear and ask you if you want to 
                            install this app. Confirm and let the installation 
                            begin</li>
                        </ol>
                        
                        <p>This is all you need to do with the apk. At times, should 
                        you wish to change from a student to a staff user, you 
                        will be required to go into your Settings -> Application 
                        Management -> Clear Data, in order to wipe the registered 
                        id details on the device. After this you must simply restart 
                        the app and register again with the new details.</p>

                        <br>
                        <h2>student ids</h2>
                        <p>On the <a href="studentIDs.html">following screen</a>, a selection 
                         of student ids ('B' numbers) are available for use with the app. The 
                         ids can be used to sign in to the device the first time 
                         to access the student interface of the app. Another use 
                         for the ids can be found in the staff interface. To 
                         register a student as in attendance, use the 'scan 
                         ids' button on the staff screen, and take as many scans 
                         as you like from any of the student ids. A summary screen 
                         will then show you how many unique ids have been scanned, 
                         any duplicates will have been filtered out!
                        </p>
                        
                        <br>
                        <h2>lecturer id</h2>
                        <p>A <a href="lecturerID.html">lecturer id</a> (begins with 'E') will provide you with access to 
                        the staff functionalities of the app, including manual 
                        check-in, automatic check-in and the ability to look up 
                        QR-Codes used to identify which class the lecturer is 
                        currently leading. </p>
                        
                        <br>
                        <h2>module codes</h2>
                        <p>I have provided a number of <a href="moduleCodes.html">module codes</a> with an option for different 
                        class types; lecture or tutorial. The student can use these 
                        QR codes to check themselves into a class - the QR-Code would 
                        be provided by the lecturer; either on a sheet, on the class 
                        door or on a slide in his/ her PowerPoint presentation for 
                        the class. Pay careful attention to the screen after signing in; 
                        a success or error message will be displayed depending on 
                        the result. The lecturer can also scan a QR-Code in the 
                        automatic scan function. They can scan this to set the class 
                        details (which are displayed on screen) for which they wish to 
                        register the students for.</p>
                        <br>
                        
                        <h2>walk throughs</h2>
                        <p>Students would be given the opportunity to download the app on registration day. 
                         The app would be automatically loaded onto staff devices from the get-go. There are 
                         4 main scenarios outlined below to show the manjority of app functionality.</p>
                        <h4><b>situation 1 - student registration & check in</b></h4>
                        <p>Actor registers details on device using student ID card (barcode). A sample of 
                            ids can be found <a href="studentIDs.html" >here</a>. The ids are stored on a 
                            student database - the app checks for the validity of an id before registering 
                            the student on the device. This is a once only process, from the intial registration 
                            students need only open the app to use when checking in to a class.</p>
                            <p>Once registered, the main use of the app for the student is to scan in a QR-Code provided by the lecturer to register attendance. The code could be shown on screen, printed out on a piece of paper at the front of the class or scanned from the lecturer's own device (more on that later). Press 'check-in' on the app, and scan in one of the QR-Codes from <a href="moduleCodes.html"> here </a> to try it out. The app will then send the student id details to the database, a time stamp will be made of your check in time and a message will be returned to the user to confirm that the check in has been successful.</p>
                        <br>
                        <h4><b>situation 2 - lecturer; find module</b></h4>
                        <p><em>If you have just completed the student functionlity above, go to your app settings to clear any data associated with the app - otherwise you'll only see the student interface from now on!</em></p>

                        <p>From time to time the lecturer may have forgotten to add the QR-Code slide to his/ her presentation deck, or misplaced a hard copy. For this reason the lecturer UI has an option to viw all current class codes for each class a lecturer is registered to take during the semester. Use the 'find module' button to search through a list of available classes, and select from each module the corresponding QR-Code for lecture or tutorial classes. This can then be placed at the front of a lecture hall for students to scan as they arrive at the lecture (Note that this interface screen will not allow the device to go into sleep mode - it would be most irritating if the staff member had to continuously unlock the device as people arrive to check into the class).There is also a 'save info' button on this screen, to allow the lecturer to make use of these details with the other staff functions later...press the back button to return to the home screen.</p>
                        <br>
                        <h4><b>situation 3 - lecturer; card scan</b></h4>
                        <p>In the ideal situation, all students would have successfully checked themselves into a class. Perhaps, for a number of reasons, a student has not been able to do this; flat battery, no internet connetivity, missed QR-Slide, etc. A lecturer can then select the 'card scan' mode, to scan in a number of ID cards one after another, allowing him/ her to check in multiple students at once and avoiding long queues after a lecture of people who still need to register. </p>
                        <p>A lecturer can choose if he wants to scan in a new module number, or having previously found his/ her QR-Code using the 'find module' function (above), the current class deatails can be already saved on the device. Saved details are shown on the home screen at all times, and the module code is shown on this screen on the bottom left hand corner. A lecturer can only continue to scan in student IDs once class details have been saved or scanned.</p>
                        <p>Take your choice from the selection of student ids <a href="studentIDs.html" > here </a> to scan in multiple students using the 'scan student' button. After completing scanning the ids, press the back button to return to the main screen. The option to 'check in' will now have become available. A summary screen will appear to confirm the IDs that have been scanned before sending them off to the database. The user can either confirm and send this information, or press delete to return to the 'card scan' interface and start again.</p>
                        <p>This mode is also available offline - the device will store the information locally and provide the user with the option to send any 'files pending' the next time a server connection can be establised - knock off your wifi and try it out!</p>
                        <br>
                        <h4><b>situation 4 - lecturer; manual input</b></h4>
                        <p>If all else fails and a student has neither his/ her phone with them or their ID card, the only other option availble is to manually enter in the student's details. 'Manual input' allows the lecturer to enter in the student number using the device keyboard. Again, class details will be defaulted to any class saved previously using the module lookup functionality, otherwise a staff member can also enter these details with the keyboard.</p>
                        <br>
                        <h4><b>other features disabled for web version</b></h4>
                        <ol>
                            <li>wifi check - to insure that a student is on campus before allowing them to check in</li>
                            <li>device id registration - captures the unique android ID of the device a student user registers on intially, to prevent students from checking other students in using their ID cards</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h4><b>project roadmap</b></h4>
                        <ol>
                            <li>interface redeign/ rebranding for generic app</li>

                        </ol>
