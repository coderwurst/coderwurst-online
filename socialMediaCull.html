            <h1>those that had to go</h1> 
            <p>Sorry <b>bebo</b>, you were my first but the love didn't last, as 
            soon as Facebook came along you were always second best. Despite 
            holding off joining the Facebook bandwagon as long as possible, when 
            it got to the point where the only comment updates I got was from 
            ladies 'wanting a good time' or trying to sell me an assortment of 
            pills it was time to leave the sinking ship also. I have no interest 
            in your app-only reboot, some things are better left in the past!</p> 
            <p><b>myspace</b>, you are another one of my early favourites, but 
            what happened? After putting up a bit of a fight against Facebook in 
            the late naughties, it seems to be dieing a slower death that necessary. 
            Should have/ could have included something along the lines of Spotify from 
            the onset when it was THE cool music site. But, all too late now...</p>
            <p>To be fair, <b>Vemeo</b> is making some strides as an alternative 
            to Youtube. For me however, not enough to warrant an account. One 
            less distraction in my bookmark bar.</p>
            <p>I wanted <b>Ello</b> to work, I really did. I sent out recommendations 
            to my friends religiously in attempt to get a base of 'real life' 
            contacts as well as building up a collection of new, virtual friends. The virtual 
            friends came, the real one's didn't. I think it's a cool idea, but 
            there's too much of an overlap with Facebook to bring that many people 
            onto Ello, which offers the same sort of set up but without ads and 
            marketing. I hope Ello makes it, but at the moment I can't justify 
            spending any more of my time on this type of platform.</p>
            <p><b>Google +</b> is Google's problem child in an otherwise unstoppable
             juggernaut of technologies. Some people think that companies such 
            as Apple and Google have too much of an engineering mind to give the 
            more creative social platform a good go. Perhaps they're right. With 
            even Google admitting they don't have any plans for where their social 
            platform is going to go, it's time to remove this one from my bookmarks 
            bar - the account of course will remain, with so many other useful 
            websites allowing access through it!</p>
            <p><b>Pinterest</b> is apparently now geared towards the male audience 
            more so than ever before. None the less I can't see any reason for me to 
            be active on this site. Good for creative ideas, also for assimilating 
            copius amounts of time.</p>
            <p>Not only as it's another time cruncher, <b>Behance</b> has been 
            completely deleted out of protest to Adobe. They're very good at what 
            they do, I am a big fan of Photoshop and InDesign in particular. However, 
            their subscription only service for Adobe products has me with a bad 
            taste in my mouth. As a hobby 'designer' or more appropriately 'player 
            around with photos, etc' I can't justify paying the subscription fee
            each month for the rest of my life. If I was involved in Graphic 
            Design on a full time basis, and I did genuinely see a reason to have 
            somewhere online where I could showcase all my output from Adobe products
            then Behance would be it.</p>
            <p><b>Tumbler</b> was a site I never got into. Growing up I never had 
            any desire to become a blogger, with Facebook and Twitter providing
            me with a more platform to communicate with the digital world. Today 
            I have this website - no need for the Tumbler anymore.
            </p>
            
            <h1>those that nearly went</h1>
            <p>This one may surprise you but <b>Facebook</b> was on the hit list,
            it has in fact been in the line of fire on a number of occasions over 
            the last few years. Productivity suffers because of it, and some people 
            fill up my timeline with constant jibberish about their lives, which 
            should really remain in the private sphere, or at least out of my 
            daily down time. None the less, it remains. The benefits it provides
            for keeping in touch just (JUST) outweigh the negatives.</p>
            <p>I was late on the <b>Instagram</b> bandwagon due to an early love of
            the original Windows 7 phone - which had such a bad camera that photos 
            were completely out of the question. I feel as if I may have missed 
            something with the initial Instagram surge, and don't get a lot out 
            of it. The limited capability on the desktop site also causes me some 
            discomfort, but overall I have no reason to remove this app from my 
            phone. From time to time, I'll take the odd interesting photo and want 
            to upload it somewhere to an audience who will appreciate it without 
            taggin faces or adding a comment; Instagramers are the best choice for 
            this type of audience.</p>
            
            <br>
            <h1>those that survived, for now...</h1>
            <p><b>LinkedIn</b> and <b>Xing</b> are my 'go-to' networks on a 
            day-to-day basis as I look to continue to build a professional 
            Network. Xing is the German version of LinkedIn, and the Germans (and 
            Swiss and Austrians) seem to be giving it their full support. It offers 
            more or less the same features, although not as many as LinkedIn for 
            a free account. These platforms are a great way of connecting with new 
            people on a professional level. There aren't many boozey pictures on 
            my Facebook, but still at networking events I only mention my LinkedIn 
            profile, it provides a much more professional contact platform with 
            the added benefit of being able to follow people such as Richard Branson 
            and many other experts in their respective professional fields. It remains 
            a great source of inspiration and motivation, and tends to be career related 
            information that actually helps my development.</p>
            <p><b>Twitter</b> has won me over in the last year. I initially had twitter 
            back when it started in 2006, but lost interest after a number of months either 
            due to my obsession with Facebook growing up or because of following the wrong 
            people. I rejoined and left twitter a further 2 times, before joining one last time 
            in late 2013 and haven't looked back since. This time I have tried to
            avoid adding my friends as much as possible (hear me out), as I have 
            them all already on Facebook. I don't need to see the same message twice
             on 2 different feeds. This time I have concentrated on following interesting 
            people who are stimulating for a number of different reasons. Some are 
            Software developers like myself, other's simply live in  
            cities that interest me, or share hobbies that I like to keep in touch with. 
            Twitter is now for me the best of all the social media sites, I just 
            hope they don't play around with the format too much, as I hear that 
            financially the current model is not sustainable. Once money comes into 
            play, I fear for how and what changes will be made to this great platform.</p>
            <p>Finally, <b>Flickr</b> is my new photo sharing website. I always had a keen 
            interest in photography, but only showed my photos to family or friends 
            in person; either in constantly changing picture frames around the house 
            or with albums and photobooks. Before I rejoined Flickr earlier this year, 
            I didn't feel that there was an appropriate online platform for sharing photos
            with others. Of course I uploaded Facebook and Twitter pics, but 
            the pictures I actually think of as 'Photography' I had kept at home, locally 
            on my machine to throw up on screen every now and again when people were 
            round. I think this has changed with my return to Flickr. I carefully select 
            photos which I upload, and again I will avoid adding my 
            Facebook friends as much as possible to concentrate on connecting with 
            new individuals. Flickr for me is more of an output for creativity 
            as a site for keeping in touch with friends. Keeping in mind this functionality, 
            and avoiding getting too caught up in the networking side of things, I believe
            that I can use Flickr as a tool to connect with interesting people who 
            also share a passion for photography.</p><br>
