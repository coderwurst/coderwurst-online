            <h4 class="blog-post-title">student life Belfast - app prototype</h4>
            <p class="blog-post-meta">December , 2013 by <a href="aboutme.html">coderwurst</a></p>
            <p><b>University of Ulster, Commercial App Competition Group Project - Winners 2013</b></p>
            <p>Technologies:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Android</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Competition Brief: 'Students to come up with an idea and implement a prototype of an app with commercial viability. Entries to be judged at the University by a panel of experts, students will have a 5 minute pitch period to justify the app and why it would be commercially attractive for investors...'</p>
            <p>The purpose of this project was not about coding ability but instead focused on learning how to work in an Agile environment. Each of the 3 members of the team took turns performing Scrum Master duties whilst the team took the project from a Java console based initial design to an Android based App prototype. The prototype is available below, however with a total development time of 6 weeks it is somewhat restricted (developed for demo and pitch on a 6 inch tablet, due to time contraints it is non-responsive to other devices, the app also features static map screen shots, instead of incorporating the Google Maps API).</p>

            <p>The app was aimed at students moving to Belfast for University, to help them get to know the surrounding area. The City was split into 3 main areas and pinned student hot spots for eating, shopping and drinking on an interactive a google map. Each location was rated for value for money, contained a link to the company website and had a brief description of what the establishment offered. Some locations were set up with dummy discount codes - an actual release of this application would be able to negotiate deals with stores to make the app more attractive to potential users and providing a source of income for the development team. The app would be crowd sourced, as users are able to rate and review places they have visited using a star based rating system. </p><br>
            <p><a href="https://github.com/coderwurst/student-life-belfast">github repo</a></p><br>
            <p>This idea was commended for its simplicity and scalability - one app for one city could be expanded to each University city in the UK and further afield. While the possibility was there for another version to be created for the tourist industry. The app would be free to buy, but businesses would be charged to advertise their location within the app or have to offer discounts for users.</p>
