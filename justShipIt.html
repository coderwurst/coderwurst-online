            <p>Having added and moved, removed and re-added more tiles to and from my <a href="https://trello.com">Trello</a> board than I'd like to admit, it became apparent that I was putting far too many hours into attempting a pixel perfect website, with too much content spread over a vast range of topics for which I really didn't have enough quality material for. Initially there were 6 sections to this website, and I agonized as to how to arrange them meaningfully whilst maintaining some sort of connection across the individual areas. A lost cause.</p>
            <p>Whilst stripping out the rot from what I had built up so far, I thought to myself I can't really do this without getting some sort of feedback on where I got with it, where I went wrong and what to do next. The best way it seemed for me to do this, was to get the website online so that I could see the end result myself and ask others for feedback.</p>
            <p>Once the website went live, the motivation was no longer a pixel perfect website, but instead a continual and gradual improvement project where I could add and change little aspects and let people provide feedback in the direction the website is going. All in all, the only thing that was holding me back from getting my website out there was my perfectionism. Once these shackles were removed I could concentrate on slowly building content and improving my writing abilities whilst continually improving the presentation. At least now I have something to use as a benchmark, and I know for next time - when in doubt and not getting anywhere, just ship it!</p>
