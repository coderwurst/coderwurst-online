# coderwurst-online

Personal Website created at beginning of 2015 to help document my side projects. Previously online at www.coderwurst.com,
after months of neglect I decided not to renew my domain. Journal section also includes some notes that helped me achieve
with my Goethe German B1 exam at the beginning of 2016.

Published on GitHub in June 2017, with the view to update & maintain the website again as I continue my development in the
following areas:
* Java
* Elixir
* GWT

Current Technologies implemented within website:
* Bootstrap
* JavaScript
* Flikr API
* JQuery (including project 'twbs-FlickrCarousel' http://jguadagno.github.io/twbs-FlickrCarousel/)
