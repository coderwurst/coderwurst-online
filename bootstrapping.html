                        <p>Bootstrap has become a popular open source front-end framework for web and mobile development. Originally created in mid-2010 by Twitter, it was released to the public in August 2011. Licensed under MIT, Bootstrap offers any developer with a bit of experience in web design the opportunity to get a responsive website up and running with consistency across a wide range of browesers and devices, in a  fraction of the time needed previously.</p>

                        <p>The compiled and minified CSS, JavaScript, and fonts, as well as the source code and SASS files can be downloaded from the Getting Started download page <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/getting-started/">here</a>.</p>

                        <p>A basic template is available to give you a good idea of how Bootstrap is put together, you can pick
                            one of the other examples that range from a starter template, a Bootstrap theme, a grids layout, a Jumbotron, a narrow Jumbotron (this website), navigation bars, custom components such as a carousel, blog page, dashboard, sign-in page, and more.</p>

                        <p>Bootstrap uses media queries to customize the CSS based on various conditions, including ratios and widths. Once the grid template has been resized to provide the most appropriate layout for the screen, the framework places and sizes your web elements on screen. More information on the grid display and how 
                            it works, can be found <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/css/">here</a>.</p>

                        <p>Depending on the device, Bootstrap also provides several responsive utility classes that are available for faster mobile-friendly development and can be used to either show or hide content.</p>

                        <p>Overall I was very impressed with how easy Bootstrap was to implement. With no previous web 
                            development experience, I was able to spin up a website within a couple of days. Although it 
                            is still not the finished product, it gets something out there and provides a solid base to 
                            continue to develop on. There are as with any technology, many pros and cons of using it. Instead
                            of lisitng my arguments here, there are already a number of good resources available on the subject:
