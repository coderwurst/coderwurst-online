                        <h3>2010 - 2013</h3>
                        <p>I left Uni in 2010 with a 1st Class Honours in Architectural Technology and a BA in Architecture from the University of Lincoln. Despite 2 years of work experience on projects with clients such as the Ulster Museum and Royal Victoria Hospital, both in Belfast, I was still unable to gain paid employment in the UK Construction industry.</p>

                        <p>I ended up taking on the position of Kitchen Planner at IKEA in Belfast. After a fun and successful year of planning kitches, I decided to take advantage of working for such a multinational company and moved within IKEA to Austria - with the goal of learning the German Language and gaining employment on the continent. After a year in Austria, I held 2 positions in Germany - as a technical Consultant for Garaventa Lift in Cologne, and an Architectural Assistant at FSH Ingenieurplanung. Despite enjoying my time in Germany, I had learned that my studies would not be recognised by the German architectural authorities. So I had a choice - go back to Uni to start Architecture all over again, or learn something new...</p>

                    <h3>2013 - 2016</h3>
                        <p>I choose something new, a Masters in Software Development. I was suprised and motivated by how many of the methods and practices withing Software Development were similar to those learnt in my time in Architecture - instead of producing technical drawings, I was outputing lines of code (and sometimes UIs too!). The working world of IT is a different level than that of construction, with 2 months left of my studies I had already received several offers for a development job, I took a position at Liberty IT in Belfast - a development department of Liberty Mutual of Boston, America.</p>

                        <p>At Liberty I was placed on the Usability Team for a Commercial Insurance Product. I learnt a lot during my time at Liberty about Usability concepts, using the company's Style Guide and the Products already established patterns to continually improve on the service offered to Insurance Agents all over America. Despite the great team I had at Liberty, I always regretted moving away from Germany. I took my first official German lessons at the Goethe Institute in Dublin and started looking for my next position - with a short list of Bonn, Hamburg or Berlin.</p>

                    <h3>2016 - present</h3>
                        <p>I left the shores of Belfast for the second time in May 2016, heading to Bonn to start as a Java Developer for cronn GmbH. Cronn attracted me as it was a small company, and I had struggled at Liberty with the big company thinking and politics that come with it. My first project at cronn was a Web GUI for provisioning Software used by call center agents for the Deutsche Telekom. The project was replicated for several countries; I was mainly involved with the Netherlands, and Germany.</p>
                        
                        <p>After a successful release of the initial application, including Accessibilty accrediation, a redesign to improve the general usability and to modernise the design for the next iteration of new features to the product, I was asked if I would like to take on a new challenge as a Designer for a small team to produce a Proof of Concept for a new product within the Telekom. I started the position of Team Designer in September 2017 and have remained in this position as the project has grown from 7 people to around 150 today. During this time, I have been able to pull from my experience right from the beginning of my architectural work, to what I learned on the Usability team in Belfast at Liberty IT, and including my front end experience gained as I developed the WebGUI project I started at cronn.</p>
