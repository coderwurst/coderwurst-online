                        <h2>System Out Statements</h2>
                        <p>The most basic and only thing they did teach at my University
                            is how to use System out statements to show the values of data 
                            values. This is the most basic type of debugging, but is not to be 
                            ignored. In the early stages of learning how to code, printing 
                            out as much information as possible as your program steps through 
                            it's methods not only makes it easier to identify mistakes quickly, 
                            but also helps you to understand if and how your code is working.</p>

                        <h2>IDE Debugger</h2>
                        <p>Most IDE debuggers consist of 2 core element - the breakpoint and the 
                            debugging interface. With IntelliJ the interface pops up in a window 
                            at the bottom of your workspace when you choose to start the program 
                            in debug mode. With Eclipse a new perspective opens. Both function more 
                            or less in the same way, though it may take you a while to get your head 
                            around the different interfaces.</p>
                        <p>Debugger tools: </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>place a <strong>breakline</strong> (or breaklines) at any line in the code that 
                                you want to test. You can do this by double clicking to the left of you 
                                line of code, where the line numbers are usually shown. Note that 
                                when the debugger stops on that line, 
                                it will require another step for the variables to be filled with data.
                                Imagine that the debugger has landed on your line before anything has 
                                been processed in the program. There are 3 main options at this stage - 
                                step over, step into and, if you are already in a method by this stage, step out of. 
                                These can all be found in the debugger interface, similar icons but different 
                                locations for each IDE!</li>
                            <li><strong>step over</strong> will allow the developer to go through each line of code, one at a time, 
                                and provide attributes and values for variables in the program at each 
                                stage. If you pause a program, variable values will also be shown in a 
                                summary table or by simply hovering over the variable in your code.</li>
                            <li><strong>step into</strong> is slightly different as it will take 
                                the developer into the method currently being called. If you are 
                                working on a large code base it may be hard to tell how far down 
                                in the source code your variable, object or method is being passed. Try to 
                                find a call that uses your object, then using this debug function it is 
                                possible to step into that call and follow it through the program. Once you 
                                have stepped into a method, it is possible to use step over to stay in this 
                                method and continue as before.</li>
                            <li><strong>step out</strong> can be used to move back up and out of 
                                any method which you have stepped into. If you step into a method 
                                and discover that it isn't what you thought it was, instead of having 
                                to restart the debug from scratch it may be possible to step out and 
                                back into the level you were debugging previously.</li>
                            <li><strong>continue</strong> is usually symbolised with a pause and play arrow, 
                                will allow the program to function again as normally, until another breakpoint 
                                is hit or the program finishes.</li>
                            <li><strong>pause</strong> can temporarily suspend the program and 
                                give a summary of the variables in use and their current values.</li>

                        </ul>

                        <h2>Web Debugger</h2>
                        <p>At the minute I do all of my web debugging on Chrome. Chrome is 
                            simple to use and a dev lead on our project team has created a number 
                            of add-ons that make it do everything I need it to whilst working 
                            on the project. I am also look at the new developer edition by 
                            Firefox - but haven't been able to get as comfortable with it as I am 
                            with Chrome, it seems to be getting very good feedback online from 
                            devs who previously worked with the normal Firefox debugger tool.</p>

                        <p>The Chrome debugger interface, seen above, gives you all the views
                            you need to debug Javascript and sometimes HTML coding errors.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>elements </strong>- use the magnifying glass to hover over and select 
                                any page element to show the code & style attributes assigned to 
                                the element. In Chrome it is possible to edit and save these 
                                attributes temporarily, in order to test a new size, etc.</li>
                            <li><strong>network </strong>- allows the developer to view 
                                what is being passed between the site and the server. Useful when 
                                working with databases, etc to view the calls being made, how much 
                                time they take and what the response is.</li>
                            <li><strong>sources </strong>- shows the source files for the 
                                website. Again attributes within the source code can be edited and 
                                saved here to be immediately tested on the page. This source code 
                                is particularly useful when working on larger projects with a lot 
                                of JavaScript - errors shown in the console can be identified and 
                                a solution tested in Chrome, before heading back into the original 
                                code and making the update.</li>
                            <li><strong>console</strong>- the console will show any system output 
                                statements, including errors, at runtime. If you see any red dots 
                                with a white x through it (5 in the example) then the console is 
                                the first place to look. Although the line number and error message 
                                cannot always be trusted to be the root problem of the cause, it 
                                will generally start you on the right path.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>I have skipped over the profiles, resources or audit tabs as I have 
                            had little experience with them so far. When I do, I will update 
                            this post to include them!</p>

                        <p>If you have tried with the debugger and still can't get to the 
                            source of the problem, another option is to use <strong>alert statements</strong> 
                            in JavaScript. These can be placed wherever you want in the code. If
                            the alert statement fires, you know that the program is getting 
                            to that point in the code. You can also include in the alert message 
                            a value from the code - similar to the System.out.println statements
                            in Java!</p>

                        <h2>Device Debugger</h2>
                        <p>Responsive design demands that an application work on devices of 
                            all sizes. It is important to appreciate that applications that work 
                            on a computer screen, may behave quite differently on a mobile device.
                            I have experienced a few JavaScript problems brought about by the differences 
                            between iOS and Android. These errors will only show when running on 
                            a device. I am not a big fan of emulators - they are handy than getting 
                            out an actual device, but they too have shown inconsistency with how 
                            they react to certain events and that of a tablet. </p>
                        <p>To debug on a tablet, Chrome provides a remote debugging tool. With 
                            the installation of a driver for the device, and hitting the site 
                            chrome://inspect/#devices, it is possible to have the same functionality 
                            explained with the Web debugger. Simply plug the tablet, phone or watch 
                            into your PC and connect.</p><br>
