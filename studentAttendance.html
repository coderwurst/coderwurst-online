            <p>A Keynote presentation was put together with 3 main goals: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>describe the purpose behind the app</li>
                <li>live demonstration of all app features</li>
                <li>outline the technologies used, describe implementation</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>A lot of time was left at the end for questions and answers, which
             actually took place right in the middle of the presentation. As the 
            3 markers got to try the app, each started to ask their own questions 
            regarding how it works. One question lead into another and kept going for 
            nearly 30 minutes. I think next time I would plan this into the 
            presentation - as it makes more sense to answer all questions at 
            once, and the natural break in presenting allowed for the questions 
            to be asked and answered in a casually.</p>

            <p>After a number of unit and user tests, the codebase was further updated and developed
            to include some suggestions or resolve bugs discovered in the development process. Unit 
            testing made use of the debugger and console log functionality in Android. Using 
            meaningful error log messages, it was possible to determine exactly what information 
            had been passed between the server and the app. With the help if this and the debugger, 
            the source of problems could be found and resolved efficiently.</p>

            <p>Despite constant user testing at all stages of development, many 
            cracks in the software only started to appear once the prototype 
            was tested by other users. A selection of ages, gender and career 
            backgrounds was specifically chosen to cover the widest range of 
            user possibilities when choosing the test subjects. Most of the 
            feedback included aesthetic changes to make the app more usable for 
            those not familiar with it. Other technical issues were also found as 
            this was the first time that the architecture was really tested, for 
            example when scanning 10 - 15 student IDs at once which created a 
            problem with sending the information one at a time to the server and 
            the time it took the device to process the next ID. All outlined 
            issues were overcome before the final presentation.</p>

            The total coding for this project lasted 12 weeks from initial project through 
            to completion. Throughout this time there were numerous challenges, which were 
            only efficiently overcome after the implementation of console log statements allowing the 
            developer to effectively establish where the problems where in the code and therefore
            implement the appropriate solution.
            
            <p>Communication between the app and the database was the biggest challenge, with 
            the sequence of operations proving to be a vital component in the overall operation
            of the app. Once the data was transferred, the scripts and code could be debugged through
            the respective IDE's - IntelliJ and MySQLWorkbench.</p>

            Having looked at the front end of the app, it was now time to nail down the 
            details of how the different components would work. On the back end is a 
            fairly simple but powerful database, to hold student and staff IDs, QR-Codes for
            classes across the campus and the check-in information updated each time a student 
            uses the app to register attendance.
            
            <p>An extra feature added to the Database was the timestamp, to record the time that
            a student checked in at this end rather than using the device clock - which 
            could be manipulated by cunning students.</p>
            
            <p>In the middle, AJAX was the chosen method of communication between the app, installed on 
            a mobile device, and the database. Ajax requests could be sent to and from the device and 
            database, with PHP scripts on the back end performing the functionality, and Android code
            in the app on the client side.</p>

            Wireframe diagrams showing possibilities for button layout were developed with 2 
            things in mind: 1) Keeping the number of buttons to a minimum, especially in the 
            case of the student user so that only a minimal amount of effort would be needed 
            to operate the app, and 2) Each function provided by the app should be no more than
            3 button clicks away from the main screen. The second of these 2 approaches being 
            a common technique in the development of web sites.
            
            <p>The Student UI was a lot easier to design, as they only had 2 screens, one to 
            initially register on the device (which is also used for lecturer users) and a
            second screen to provide a button with which the student could check into a 
            class with by opening the QR-Code scanner.</p>
            
            <p>The Lecturer UI needed a lot more time and thought, from the naming of the 
            buttons to the layout on screen to allow the user access to functionality 
            without cluttering the screen so much which would then become cumbersome 
            on smaller mobile devices. As well as the main screen, a total of 3 other screens
            were also included - one for displaying QR-Codes for chosen classes, another 
            for registering a number of students as attending all at once and a third to 
            manually enter the details of any students' who had forgotten their student 
            card with the necessary barcode to be scanned in automatically.</p>

            Storyboards of the current situation where drawn u in order to outline the exact problems being
            faced with the current attendance recording system - as well as students avoiding class, there
            were also instances of the lecturer or university staff misplacing the attendance sheet, or misreading
            the information as details were transferred from the sheet and onto the attendance database.</p>
            
            <img src="images/storyboard.jpg" width="100%" height="100%">
            
            <p>A study was conducted into the best platform to solve the problem, the sales numbers for iOS, Android 
            and Windows Phone were compared as well as app store downloads and purchases. The Android OS towards 
            the end of 2013 made up around 80% of the smartphone market... Apple came in second at 16%, with Microsoft 
            at around 4%. As this was to be a native designed application - Android provided the greatest coverage in 
            terms of making my app accessible for the greatest number of users.</p>
            
            <p>The study also identified that free apps make up 95% of all app store purchases, in all app stores. The Android store
            posted revenues of $9 billion in 2013 and 2014. Not bad considering that 95% of app downloads are free! As this is only 
            a side project, revenue is not an important design factor - but it is good to bear this in mind, should the project
            take a more commercial route in the future.</p>
            
            <p>Final preparations where made in the creation of the development environment. IntelliJ IDE was chosen for its better usability
            and flexibility - Eclipse is the industry standard, but I have never understood why. Anyone who takes the time to develop 
            at least one project with IntelliJ will know that it provides the much more professional, complete product - even the 
            community edition that is available free of charge.</p>
            
            <p>After completing the initial investigations, a MoSCoW list was put together to outline the project objectives in a 
            tangible form, this will be referred throughout the project in the creation of Agile project scripts and also when creating 
            usability testing scripts to validate that the end product satisfies the initial objectives.</p>

            <p>Student attendance is a key measure that Universities use to predict student
            performance, and is also an early indicator of potential drop outs on any course - 
            the less a student attends, the more a student falls behind and the less likely
             the student will be able to catch up on his/ her peers. For this reason a University 
            gave me the task of tackling the problem of student non-attendance with the production 
            of a mobile application. The main problem outlined in the early design stages - students signing
             their friends into class, whilst their friends take a day off, are working  part-time jobs 
             or have been partying too hard and are skipping yet another class to catch up on some sleep.</p>
            
            <p>Lecturers are aware of this, they are also aware of the same students who sign in late 
            to class every week, and equally aware of those who sign in first thing only to leave at the 
            break. They do not however, know of a way to resolve this problem in a non-confrontational manor.</p>
            
            <p>If there's one thing that comes hand in hand in todays society its students and smart
             phones. For this reason, an app seemed the most logical platform to develop a solution to 
            the many problems that the current paper based sign-in system in Universities use to monitor 
            student attendance.</p>
            
            <p>It is also not just the students that pose problems for accurate attendance monitoring - lecturers
            can forget/ loose sign-in sheets, and data can be transferred incorrectly by the administrators 
            as they manually transfer attendance information into University Databases</p>
